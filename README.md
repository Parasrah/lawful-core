# FoundryVTT Lawful Loot Mod

The first module as part of the lawful collection, Lawful Loot & Trade seeks to improve the item situation in Foundry for dnd5e. Like all Lawful modules, it has an emphasis on code quality, playing well with other modules and with the base game system.

## Instructions

This module is not currently ready for the public, but is close to a 1.0 release at which point this section **should** have all the information you need to get started.

## Why GPL-3.0?

Among the goals of this module is consistency and stability. In other words, the sheets in this module should be similar to those in the dnd5e system, while not breaking when that system is updated. In order to achieve these goals, a lot of the templates and sheets were originally copied from [the dnd5e system](https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/dnd5e), which due to its license requires all derived works fall under the same license.
