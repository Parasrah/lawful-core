# FoundryVTT Lawful Loot Mod

The first module as part of the lawful collection, Lawful Loot & Trade seeks to improve the item situation in Foundry for dnd5e. Like all Lawful modules, it has an emphasis on code quality, playing well with other modules and with the base game system.

## Sources

A lot of the code has been modified from the [dnd5e system](https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/dnd5e). This was done to ensure the look and feel is close to the default dnd5e loot sheets, while the duplication was done to hopefully prevent the module breaking when that system is updated.
