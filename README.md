# FoundryVTT Lawful Loot Mod
A FoundryVTT module to support the other lawful modules

## Loot & Trade

All entities can optionally be attached to a rolltable, allowing the initial contents to be dictated
by the results of said table. There should be triggers in all sheets to re-roll the contents, and
would be nice to add an optional tie-in to About Time to support automagically re-rolling the contents
after specific amounts of time. This would obviously be more useful on the merchant, but could also have
applications on the loot containers.

Loot containers should only be accessible to a player that has a token in a close range to it.

If a player has a token near a loot container and interacts with it, they should have the option
to "share with party", which opens a sheet containing the contents of the container, and allowing
to "claim" a portion of the loot. If more than one player lays claim to the same entities, should
support rolling a random ability contest to see who receives it.

Loot container should also support divying up all currency inside the chest equally amongst the group.
